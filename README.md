| Sprint # |                      Target                     | Time (actual) |
|----------|-------------------------------------------------|---------------|
|        5 | Use digispark as Arduino (CapacitySensor)       | 30            |
|        4 | Use digispark as Arduino (LED)                  | 30 (47)       |
|        3 | Play with programmable LED strip                | 30 (10)       |
|        2 | Git repo, Statemachine, Multi-step state machie | 40 (40)       |

#### Todos
* Investigate Electronics Safet y Rules :-)
* Use Digispark as Arduino (CapacitySensor)
* Use 12 V output for light
* Add image of capacity graph
* Add image of state machine
* Add photo of basic setup

#### Done
* ~~Use Digispark as Arduino (LED)~~
* ~~Use programmable LED strip~~
* ~~Create git repo~~
* ~~Introduce statemachine   ~~
* ~~Multi-step statemachine 0 -> 1 -> 2 -> 0~~
